 *
 * This structure contains minimal amount of objects, that are required to
 * work with OpenCL, such as:
 *   - List of OpenCL platforms (which includes list of OpenCL Devices for each
 *     platform) and information about platforms & devices
 *   - OpenCL context
 *   - OpenCL program
 *   - Command queues:
 *     - Host to Device
 *     - Device to Host
 *     - Device to Device
 *     - Queue for kernel ND range
 *
 * Also it provides functionality as follows:
 *   - Auto-detection of OpenCL platforms & OpenCL Devices
 *   - Ability to load/store pre-compiled OpenCL program
 *   - Ability to load & compile OpenCL program from source files and/or strings
 *
 * @example cl_steel_thread_t_sample.c
